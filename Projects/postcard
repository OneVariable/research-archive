# Postcard

## Name
postcard 1.0.4

## Summary
Postcard is a `#![no_std]` focused serializer and deserializer for Serde.

Postcard aims to be convenient for developers in constrained environments, while allowing for flexibility to customize behavior as needed.
## Goals
1. Design primarily for `#![no_std]` usage, in embedded or other constrained contexts
1. Support a maximal set of `serde` features, so `postcard` can be used as a drop in replacement
1. Avoid special differences in code between communication code written for a microcontroller or a desktop/server PC
1. Be resource efficient - memory usage, code size, developer time, and CPU time; in that order
1. Allow library users to customize the serialization and deserialization behavior to fit their bespoke needs

## Current State
### Format Stability
As of v1.0.0, `postcard` has a documented and stable wire format. More information about this wire format can be found in the `spec/` folder of the Postcard repository, or viewed online at https://postcard.jamesmunns.com.

Work towards the Postcard Specification and portions of the Postcard 1.0 Release were sponsored by Mozilla Corporation.
